# Cheatsheet Site

This page contains tables of things (in the realm of HTML, CSS and Javascript) that I find myself forgetting or wishing I had a quick way of accessing.

## Purpose

The purpose if this project was to practive simple HTML/CSS while also giving myself a cheatsheet of things that I personally find useful


## Features

* Tables of tags and descriptions for HTML, CSS and Javascript
* Internal linking with smooth scrolling
* A mutlicolor background made with only CSS, using [this](https://codioful.com/) website

## Planning to add

* Scroll snapping for each table
* "Scroll back to top" button that appears after scrolling for some time
* Possibly another button to scroll up one element, rather than to the top

            HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML
            stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML describes the structure
            of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements that tell the
            browser how to display the content. HTML elements label pieces of
            content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is
            a link", etc.

                the relationship between the HTML document and the linked
                document. In this case, it's a stylesheet. The "href" attribute
                specifies the location of the linked document. In this case,
                it's a file called mystyle.css in the same folder as the HTML
                file.

                encoding that can represent most characters from all writing

                and initial-scale is the default zoom level. Important for
                responsive design.

                "description" in this table, or &lt;td&gt for table data, which

          <p>
            CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document. CSS stands for
            Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be
            displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of
            work as it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
            External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

              <th>Tags</th>
              <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Make the browser accurately calculate element sizes</td>
              <td>box-sizing: border-box</td>
              <td>
                By default, the width and height of an element is calculated
                like this: width + padding + border = actual width of an
                element. This can be annoying when you're trying to make a
                responsive design. By setting box-sizing to border-box, the
                width and height of an element is calculated like this: width =
                actual width of an element. This means that the padding and
                border are included in the width and height.
              </td>

            <tr>

              </td>
              <td>position: static, relative, absolute, fixed</td>
              <td>
                Static is the default, and it means that the element will be
                positioned according to the normal flow of the page. Relative
                means that the element will be positioned relative to its normal
                position. Absolute means that the element will be positioned
                relative to its closest positioned ancestor. Fixed means that
                the element will be positioned relative to the browser window.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

              <td>display: block, inline-block, inline</td>
              <td>
                Block elements take up the full width available, and have a line
                break before and after them. Inline-block elements take up only
                as much width as they need, and don't have a line break before
                or after them. Inline elements take up only as much width as
                they need, and have a line break before and after them. You can
                change the width of block and inline-block elements, but not
                inline elements.
              </td>

              <td>Use flexbox</td>
              <td>display: flex or inline-flex</td>
              <td>
                Flexbox is a layout mode that arranges elements in a predictable
                way for different screen sizes and orientations. It's great for
                responsive design. See full image

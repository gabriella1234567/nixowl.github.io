# Website Design

## Description

This was supposed to be a simple website project for Codecademy to create a directory of fonts and colors to keep as reference. I decided to challenge myself and created both a color palette generator and font pairing generator, complete with a tiny website preview.

## Color Generator

Works by selecting a random light hsl color and then randomizing a second, darker color that is close in hue to the first one. After that it randomizes two very muted colors, one light and one dark, meant to be used in place of black and white as these often look too strong and unnatural. The last color is entirely random and is meant to be used as an accent color.

## Font Pairings

Selects three different fonts:
* A display or script font, meant to be used only for big headlines
* A title font, easier to read than the first font but still has some impact to it
* A paragraph font
